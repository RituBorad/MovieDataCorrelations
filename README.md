# MovieDataCorrelations

How to find a perfect movie to watch on a movie night? Should we consider ratings, personal interest, popularity, budget or somwthing else?
I have used python to identify correlations between different variables like budget, popularity, gross revenue etc.

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies

Conclusions:
- Budget is highly correlated to Gross Earning
- Votes is highly correlated to Gross Earning
- Company has very little correlation to Gross Earning
